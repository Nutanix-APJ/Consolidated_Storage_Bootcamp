Deploy Files
++++++++++++

#. In **Prism > File Server**, click **+ File Server**.

   .. figure:: images/1.png

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Name** - *Intials*-Files (e.g. XYZ-Files)
   - **Domain** - ntnxlab.local
   - **File Server Size** - 1 TiB

   Clicking **Custom Configuration** to change Files Server VM number to 1（for lab purpose here）. This option will allow you to alter the scale up and scale out sizing of the Files VMs based on User and Throughput targets. It also allows for manual sizing of the Files cluster.

#. Click **Next**.

#. Select the **Primary - Managed** VLAN for the **Client Network**.

   Each Files VM will consume a single IP on the client network.

   .. note::

     Using separate client and storage networks is typically desirable in production environments to deploy Files with dedicated virtual networks for client and storage traffic. When using two networks, Files will, by design, disallow client traffic the storage network, meaning VMs assigned to the primary network will be unable to access shares.

#. Specify your cluster's **Domain Controller** VM IP (found VM named AutoAD in VM list) as the **DNS Resolver IP** (e.g. 10.XX.YY.41). Leave the default (cluster) NTP Server.

     <strong><font color="red">In order for the Files cluster to successfully find and join the NTNXLAB.local domain it is critical that the DNS Resolver IP is set to the Domain Controller VM IP FOR YOUR CLUSTER. By default, this field is set to the primary Name Server IP configured for the Nutanix cluster, this value is incorrect and will not work.</font></strong>

#. Click **Next**.

#. Select the **Primary - Managed** VLAN for the Storage Network.

   Each Files VM will consume a single IP on the storage network, plus 1 additional IP for the cluster.

#. Click **Next**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - Select **Use SMB Protocol**
   - **Username** - Administrator@ntnxlab.local
   - **Password** - nutanix/4u
   - Select **Make this user a File Server admin**
   - Select **Use NFS Protocol**
   - **User Management and Authentication** - Unmanaged

#. Click **Next**.

   By default, Files will automatically create a Protection Domain to take daily snapshots of the Files cluster and retain the previous 2 snapshots. After deployment, the snapshot schedule can be modified and remote replication sites can be defined.

   .. figure:: images/10.png

#. Click **Create** to begin the Files deployment.

#. Monitor deployment progress in **Prism > Tasks**.

   Deployment should take approximately 10 minutes.

   .. figure:: images/11.png

   .. note::

     If you receive a warning regarding DNS record validation failure, this can be safely ignored. The shared cluster does not use the same DNS servers as your Files cluster, and as a result is unable to resolve the DNS entries created when deploying Files.

#. Go to **Prism > File Server** and select the *Initials*\ **-Files** server and click **Protect**.

   .. figure:: images/12.png

#. Observe the default Self Service Restore schedules, this feature controls the snapshot schedule for Windows' Previous Versions functionality. Supporting Previous Versions allows end users to roll back changes to files without engaging storage or backup administrators. Note these local snapshots do not protect the file server cluster from local failures and that replication of the entire file server cluster can be performed to remote Nutanix clusters. Click **Close**.

Takeaways
+++++++++

What are the key things you should know about **Nutanix Files**?

- Files can be rapidly deployed on top of existing Nutanix clusters, providing SMB and NFS storage for user shares, home directories, departmental shares, applications, and any other general purpose file storage needs.
- Files is not a point solution. VM, File, Block, and Object storage can all be delivered by the same platform using the same management tools, reducing complexity and management silos.
